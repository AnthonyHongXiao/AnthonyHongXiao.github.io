本科时我至少有两个同学对我说过：教授总说复分析很美妙，但我到现在也没看出来它到底美妙在哪里。那时我常用“黎曼面很美”来回应，仿佛只要把“黎曼面”这三个字抛出来，美就会自动成立。但坦白说，我自己也并不完全信服：美不能只靠口号。今天我想拿出更多证据——不是靠玄妙的形容词，而是靠复分析本身那种令人无法忽视的结构性力量。
我越来越觉得，复函数理论在某种意义上可以看作实函数理论的一种“完备化”：它不仅保留了实分析的许多成果，还以一种近乎“不可思议的强制力”把局部信息扩展成全局结论；把微分、积分、几何、拓扑、代数悄无声息地焊接成一个整体。下面我尝试从几个角度解释它为何令人心服口服。
一、$\mathbb C$ 的诞生：为了解一个方程，却打开一整个维度 $\mathbb C$ 作为 $\mathbb R$ 的域扩张，最初的动机朴素得近乎可笑：只是想给方程 $$ x^2+1=0 $$ 留一个解的位置。于是我们把 $i^2=-1$ 加进来，得到 $$ \mathbb C \cong \mathbb R[X]/(X^2+1), $$ 仿佛只是给实数系“补了一个洞”。然而这一补，不是补丁，而是开天辟地：它把一条实轴变成一张平面，让代数、几何、分析的疆域都发生了重组。
更震撼的是：$\mathbb C$ 竟然是代数闭域——每个非零复系数多项式都有根。换言之，复数不仅“让某个方程有解”，它几乎让“所有该有解的代数方程都能在此闭合”。这就是代数基本定理的意义：它像一种“完备性宣言”，宣布多项式的世界在复数里终于不再流离失所。
而代数基本定理最迷人的部分，并不在于结论本身，而在于它的证明路径：除了纯代数证明，还有分析学证明、拓扑学证明。一个关于根的命题，居然能从不同学科的地下隧道被运送到地面——这深刻揭露了数学各地域之间并非孤岛，而是隧道纵横、暗流相通。复分析就是这张交通网里最繁忙的一段枢纽。
二、复微分的高明：把“比较”从外在结构中解放出来 我们在实分析里处理 $f:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^m$ 的可微性，几乎不可避免要引入范数： $$ \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{|f(x+h)-f(x)-Lh|}{|h|}=0. $$ 范数本身当然是自然的，但它也像一种额外的外在装置：既然引入了装置，就要付出代价——你要解释为什么更换范数不影响可微性（需要等价范数），要解释为什么某些论证对范数选择具有不变性。换句话说，这里“微分”并非完全从对象内部生长出来，而多少带着一层外部的脚手架。
而复分析里，导数的定义看上去朴素得惊人： $$ f^\prime(z)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}. $$ 它把“无穷小比较”写成了一个商——而商需要一个“可做除法”的代数结构来支撑。向量除以向量是没定义的，$\mathbb R^n$ 里没法直接写这个极限；但 $\mathbb C$ 是交换除环（域），$h\neq 0$ 时 $1/h$ 有意义，$(a+bi)/(c+di)$ 有唯一的定义。更妙的是：四元数 $\mathbb H$ 虽然也是除环，却不交换，你会遇到“左导数”和“右导数”不一致这种灾难——这几乎宣告了复数在微积分语境下的“天选地位”。
于是，复微分带来的不是“多了一种求导方式”，而是“求导本身被强化到极致”。一旦 $f$ 在复意义下可微，整个世界就开始多米诺骨牌式地倒下：
复可微 $\Rightarrow$ 柯西–黎曼方程； $\Rightarrow$ 解析性（可局部展开成幂级数）； $\Rightarrow$ 无限次可微，且导数由积分控制； $\Rightarrow$ 强刚性：局部信息钳制全局行为。 这就是我心目中复分析的“高明”：它把一个看似温柔的定义变成一条极其强悍的纪律。</description></item><item><title>What is Geometry?</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/what-is-geometry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 22:29:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/what-is-geometry/</guid><description>Geometry: The Rhetoric of Mathematics “Let no one ignorant of geometry enter,” Plato once inscribed above his academy, hinting that geometry is more than a mere field of study—it’s a prerequisite for higher thought. Like rhetoric, geometry structures our understanding and shapes how we interpret the world.
But what exactly is geometry? It’s nearly impossible to define without it dissolving into algebra, topology, or analysis. When we talk about metrics, we often mean analysis, while the “geometry” of graphs is actually combinatorics, using terms like diameter or bridges for rhetorical flair.</description></item><item><title>Can You Hear the Algebra</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/can-you-hear-the-algebra/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:40:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/can-you-hear-the-algebra/</guid><description>I was on a long flight from Shenzhen to LA, and like many travelers, I decided to catch up on some movies. Among the selections was Oppenheimer. One particular line in the movie struck me:
&amp;ldquo;Algebra is like a score. The question is not &amp;lsquo;can you read the music?&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;can you hear it?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
Oppenheimer’s response was quick and simple:
&amp;ldquo;Yes. I can hear it.&amp;rdquo;
In that moment, I couldn’t help but reflect on the comparison between algebra and music.</description></item><item><title>Asymptotes of algebraic curves</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/asymptotes-of-algebraic-curves/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 16:53:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/asymptotes-of-algebraic-curves/</guid><description>An asymptote of a curve is a straight line that the curve approaches as the points on the curve tend toward infinity.

Solving the Compact Bonnet Pair Problem The compact Bonnet pair problem originated from the work of Pierre Ossian Bonnet in 1867, who conjectured that two quantities of a surface, the mean curvature and the metric, uniquely determine the surface&amp;rsquo;s shape.</description></item><item><title>Multifractal</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/multifractal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 23:21:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/multifractal/</guid><description>Local Dimensions and Multifractal Spectra Multifractals provide a complex and rich framework for understanding the intricate structures seen in various natural phenomena and mathematical constructs. Central to the study of multifractals are the concepts of local dimensions and multifractal spectra, particularly the functions $ f(\alpha) $ and $ \tau(q) $. These tools allow for a deep understanding of the variability in scaling behavior across different subsets of a fractal.
Local Dimensions Local dimensions offer insights into the density of measures at specific points within a set or fractal structure.</description></item><item><title>Compare Two Powers</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/compare-two-powers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 18:07:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/compare-two-powers/</guid><description>I found an interesting way to compare two powers, $e^\pi$ and $\pi^e$, although there should have already been many interesting articles illustrating this idea and possibly including couple of more ways to compare them.

Consider the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, which is continuous and strictly decreasing for $x&amp;gt;0$. Notice that $\pi&amp;gt;e$. We then integrate the function over the intervel $[e,\pi]$ too get $$ \int_{e}^{\pi}\frac{1}{x}dx=\ln\pi-\ln e=\ln\pi -1 $$ which equals to the area under the curve $f(x)$ above the intervel $[e,\pi]$.</description></item><item><title>MBTI model</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/mbti-model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 11:09:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/mbti-model/</guid><description>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment tool designed to identify a person&amp;rsquo;s personality type, strengths, and preferences.

Contrary to the prevalent belief that applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to other fields, it is actually the reverse. In reality, applied mathematics involves using concepts and methods from other disciplines within the framework of mathematics. This is better understood when considering the difference between the terms &amp;lsquo;applied math&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;mathematical application&amp;rsquo;. The former implies a broader scope where external concepts are integrated into mathematical contexts, while the latter suggests a more limited view where mathematics is merely applied as a tool in various fields.</description></item><item><title>High-Dimensional Probability and Statistics</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob_and_satistics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 12:01:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob_and_satistics/</guid><description>This file is the first of the two for the notes and exercises in the book Roman Vershynin&amp;rsquo;s High-Dimensional Probability, one of the references used in Prof Lunde&amp;rsquo;s Math5440.
