0. Appetizer Key Takeaways convex combination $\sum^{m}{i=1}\lambda_i z_i$ where $\lambda_i\ge 0$ and $\sum^{m}{i=1}\lambda_i=1$.
convex hull of a set $T$, $\mathrm{conv}(T)={\text{convex combinations of }z_1,\cdots,z_m\in T\text{ for }m\in \mathbb{N}}$.
Theorem 0.0.1 (Caratheodory&amp;rsquo;s Theorem): Every point in the convex hull of a set $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ can be expressed as a convex combination of at most $n+1$ points from $T$.</description></item><item><title>Cayley Graphs on Surfaces</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/cayley-graphs-on-surfaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:09:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/cayley-graphs-on-surfaces/</guid><description>Some aspects may be related:

Terrace Tao&amp;rsquo;s blog: he builds some analogies of geometric structure between group and manifold, including abelianness&amp;ndash;flatness (zero curvature), subgroups&amp;ndash;foliations, normal subgroups&amp;ndash;bundles&amp;hellip;
John Meier&amp;rsquo;s little blue LMS book: Groups, Graphs, and Trees: An Introduction to the Geometry of Infinite Groups. The book &amp;ldquo;proceeds step by carefully placed step, quite rapidly and naturally through many of the key ideas of modern geometric group theory,&amp;rdquo; reviewed by Jon McCammond, UCSB.</description></item><item><title>Website logistics</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/website-logistics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 19:29:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/website-logistics/</guid><description>After committing and pushing get stucked: for uncommited changes: git commit -m &amp;ldquo;Your commit message&amp;rdquo;
discard unstaged changes (note that directly copying from website will give a single - instead of consecutive two -): git checkout &amp;ndash; .
