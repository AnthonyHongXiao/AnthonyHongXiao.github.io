Contrary to the prevalent belief that applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to other fields, it is actually the reverse. In reality, applied mathematics involves using concepts and methods from other disciplines within the framework of mathematics. This is better understood when considering the difference between the terms &amp;lsquo;applied math&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;mathematical application&amp;rsquo;. The former implies a broader scope where external concepts are integrated into mathematical contexts, while the latter suggests a more limited view where mathematics is merely applied as a tool in various fields.</description></item><item><title>High-Dimensional Probability and Statistics</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 12:01:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob/</guid><description>This file is for the notes and exercises for the book Roman Vershynin&amp;rsquo;s High-Dimensional Probability, one of the references used in Prof Lunde&amp;rsquo;s Math5440.

Terrace Tao&amp;rsquo;s blog: he builds some analogies of geometric structure between group and manifold, including abelianness&amp;ndash;flatness (zero curvature), subgroups&amp;ndash;foliations, normal subgroups&amp;ndash;bundles&amp;hellip;
John Meier&amp;rsquo;s little blue LMS book: Groups, Graphs, and Trees: An Introduction to the Geometry of Infinite Groups. The book &amp;ldquo;proceeds step by carefully placed step, quite rapidly and naturally through many of the key ideas of modern geometric group theory,&amp;rdquo; reviewed by Jon McCammond, UCSB.</description></item><item><title>Website logistics</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/website-logistics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 19:29:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/website-logistics/</guid><description>After committing and pushing get stucked: for uncommited changes: git commit -m &amp;ldquo;Your commit message&amp;rdquo;
