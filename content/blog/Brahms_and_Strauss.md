Post-romantic music, epitomized by the likes of Johannes Brahms and Richard Strauss, dives deep into a realm where intense emotions are paramount. Brahms' compositions resonate with a profound sense of grief, yet there's a fiery undercurrent of rage that seems to threaten the very fabric of the world, as if it could tear it apart and reduce it to ashes. This emotional power, coupled with the structural legacies of Beethoven and Bach, makes his music enduringly impactful.

Richard Strauss, on the other hand, captures the post-romantic spirit with a more flamboyant brush. His works are lavish and theatrical, akin to the grand spectacle of a circus, full of vibrant colors and surprising turns. The way a lava cake's rich exterior gives way to a molten heart parallels Strauss's compositionsâ€”on the surface, they are opulent, but they conceal an irony and a complexity that is both delightful and thought-provoking.

Brahms and Strauss are among my favourite composers. Brahms with the depth of his emotional landscape, where fury and sorrow intertwine, and Strauss with his elaborate orchestrations that mask deeper reflections on life's ironies. Their music does not merely entertain; it challenges us, mirrors our complexities, and indulges our senses, capturing the essence of a world that is as rich and paradoxical as the human experience itself.
