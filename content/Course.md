# Courses

This is a collection of lecture notes, assignments, links, and some other related materials of the courses I have taken.

## 1. Algebra
Thanks to Albert Peng for his permission to edit his tex file of Math5031 and also J.S. Milne’s tex file.

### [Math5031-32 Lecture Note, with homework incorporated as solved exercises](/pdfs/5031-5032_Algebra.pdf)

## 2. Algebraic Geometry
We use *Algebraic Geometry* by Robin Hartshorne as textbook but not follow it closely for some parts of the course. There will be homework on most weeks, and some of them will be chosen from Hartshorne. Some resources:

The red book of Varieties and Schemes, David Mumford. Springer Lecture Notes, 1999.

[Lecture note by Ravi Vakil](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf).

[Lecture note by Andreas Gathmann](https://agag-gathmann.math.rptu.de/de/alggeom.php).

## 3. Lie Algbera and Representation Theory

We used the following textbooks:

- Introduction to Lie Algebras, by K. Erdmann and M. J. Wildon

- Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, by J. Humphreys

- Representation Theory: A First Course, by W. Fulton and J. Harris

- Symmetry, Representations, and Invariants, by R. Goodman and N. R. Wallach

### [Math547 Lecture Note](/pdfs/547_LieAlandRep.pdf)

## 4. Measure Theory and Functional Analysis

### [Math5051-52 Lecture Note](/pdfs/5051-5052_MeasureTheory_and_FunctionalAnaysis.pdf)

## 5. Complex Analysis
I transcribed Prof. Martinkainen's written manuscripts into latex file, with several tikz illustrations.

I also add some useful remarks made by Prof. Steven Krantz in undergraduate complex analysis course Math416.

### [Math5021-22 Lecture Note](/pdfs/5021-5022_Complex_Analysis.pdf)

Above is the image of a cat by Cayley map $\frac{z-i}{z+i}$ visualized through [online conformal mapping viewer](https://mabotkin.github.io/complex/). Cute cat becomes a bear.

## 6. Differential Equations

ODE: [ODE lecture note](/pdfs/ode_lecture_note.pdf), Lebl's [online tex file](https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs), Teschl's *Ordinary Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems*.

Dynamical system and Chaos: Strogatz's *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering*.

PDE: Evans's *Partial Differential Equations*.

## 7. Differential Topology

We used John M. Lee's *Introduction to Smooth Manifold* (e2) and Tu's *Introduction to Manifold* (e2). Some other texts are also very interesting, including a classical little book Milnor's *Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint* and *Smooth Manifolds and Observables* by a group named themselves Jet Nestruev.
