# Courses

This is a collection of lecture notes, assignments, and some other related materials of the courses I have taken.

## 1. FL23-SP24 Math5031-5032 Algebra I-II, Prof. Beheshti Zavareh
Thanks to Albert Peng for his permission to edit his tex file of Math5031 and also J.S. Milneâ€™s tex file. The lecture note also adds many thoughts and exercises from other sources (see the bibliography).

## 2. FL23-SP24 Math5021-5022 Complex Analysis I-II, Prof. Martinkainen
I transcribe Prof. Martinkainen's written manuscripts into latex file, with several tikz illustrations.

I also add some useful remarks made by Prof. Steven Krantz in undergraduate complex analysis course Math416.

## 3. FL22 and SP24 (plan to take) Math5051-5052 Measure Theory and Functional Analysis I-II, Prof. Martikainen

### [Math5051-52 Lecture Note](/pdfs/5051-5052_MeasureTheory_and_FunctionalAnaysis.pdf)

## 4. FL23 Math586 Network Statistics, Prof. Lunde
Lecture Note for the course (I scribed lecture 9 and 10)

### [Math586 Lecture Note](/pdfs/586_Network_Statistics.pdf)

Final project on cross-validation on network with Aaron Luo.

## 5. SP23 Math5046 Differential Topology, Prof. Roberts
We used John M. Lee's *Introduction to Smooth Manifold* (e2). I am AI and grader for this course in SP24 with Prof. Roberts again, this time using Tu's *Introduction to Manifold* (e2). Some other texts are also very interesting, including a classical little book Milnor's *Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint* and *Smooth Manifolds and Observables* by a group named themselves Jet Nestruev.

## 6. SP24 Math547 Topics in Geometry: Theory of Polytopes, Prof. Laura Escobar
{{< imageRight src="/images/courses/conv_of_S3.png" alt="permutohedron conv(S3)" caption="permutohedron conv(S3)" height="12%" width="25%" >}}

This is a topic course for polytopes. Topics include various types of polytopes, simple polytopes, integral polytopes, permutohedrons, zonotopes, etc.; their representations, by vertices and inequalities; and their characterizations by graphs, discrete volumes, etc.

The following lecture note also includes my final project, Fourier analysis on polytopes.

## 7. SP22 Math350 Dynamical System, Prof. McCarthy
Dynamical systems can be defined as broadly as a semigroup $G$ action on a manifold $M$. Primary examples are $G=\mathbb{Z}$ (iterated maps) and $G=\mathbb{R}$ (flows and differential equations). In this Lecture note, I begin with a summary of classical ode theory partly from the summer course taught by Soumya Sinha Babu in 2021 (and also from various references (see bibliography in the pdf.)) and then use Prof. McCarthy's Math350 (SP22) where we used Strogatz's textbook as a source for supplementary examples to a more systematic approach to dynamics, chaos, and fractals, etc. See also my reading in Measures, Dimensions, and Analytic Capacities for geometry of fractals. The last part of the note is on analysis and dynamics on Riemann surfaces.

## 8. FL24 CSE546T Computational Geometry, Prof. Ju
A course in computational geometry. Topics include convex hull algorithms, sweeping line algorithm, line arrangement algorithm, trapezoidal maps, Art gallery problem, Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, KD trees, range trees, and interval trees, motion planning, DCEL, and Hamsandwich cuts ...
