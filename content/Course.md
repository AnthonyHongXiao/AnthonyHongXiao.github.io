# Courses

This is a collection of lecture notes, assignments, and some other related materials of the courses I have taken.

## FL23-SP24 Math5031-5032 Algebra I-II, Prof. Beheshti Zavareh
Thanks to Albert Peng for his permission to edit his tex file of Math5031 and also J.S. Milneâ€™s tex file. The lecture note also adds many thoughts and exercises from other sources (see the bibliography).

### [Math5031-32 Lecture Note, with homework incorporated as solved exercises](/pdfs/5031-5032_Algebra.pdf)

## FL23-SP24 Math5021-5022 Complex Analysis I-II, Prof. Martinkainen
I put Prof. Martinkainen's written manuscripts into latex file, with several tikz illustrations.

## FL23 Math586 Network Statistics, Prof. Lunde
Lecture Note for the course (I scribed lecture 9 and 10)

### [Math586 Lecture Note](/pdfs/586_Network_Statistics.pdf)

Final project on cross-validation on network with Aaron Luo.

## SP23 Math5046 Differential Topology, Prof. Roberts
We used John M. Lee's *Introduction to Smooth Manifold* (e2). I am AI and grader for this course in SP24 with Prof. Roberts again, this time using Tu's *Introduction to Manifold* (e2). Some other texts are also very interesting, including a classical little book Milnor's *Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint* and *Smooth Manifolds and Observables* by a group named themselves Jet Nestruev.

## SP22 Math350 Dynamical System, Prof. McCarthy
This is a temporarily shelved project because differential equations and dynamical systems are a broad field involving many aspects. Currently, I have only organized some theories of linear ordinary differential equations.
