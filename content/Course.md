# Courses

This is a collection of lecture notes, assignments, and some other related materials of the courses I have taken.

## FL23-SP24 Math5031-5032 Algebra I-II, Prof. Beheshti Zavareh
Thanks to Albert Peng for his permission to edit his tex file of Math5031 and also J.S. Milneâ€™s tex file. The lecture note also adds many thoughts and exercises from other sources (see the bibliography).

## FL23 Math586 Network Statistics, Prof. Lunde
Final project on cross-validation on network with Aaron Luo.

[Beamer presentaton](/pdfs/586_Cross_Validation_on_Network.pdf)

## SP22 Math350 Dynamical System, Prof. McCarthy
This is a temporarily shelved project because differential equations and dynamical systems are a broad field involving many aspects. Currently, I have only organized some theories of linear ordinary differential equations.
