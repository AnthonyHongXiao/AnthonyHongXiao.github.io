At the mid of Spring semester 2024, I began doing some readings with 
Prof. Henri Martikainen on Hausdorff measures and dimensions, fractals, and analytic capacity using Xavier Tolsa's **Analytic Capacity, the Cauchy Transform, and Non-homogeneous Calderón–Zygmund Theory**, Pertti Mattila's **Geometry of sets and measures in Euclidean spaces: Fractals and rectifiability**, and K. J. Falconer's **The Geometry of Fractal Sets**.
