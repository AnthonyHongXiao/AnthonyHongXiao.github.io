Mathematics is art, and its practicality and applicability are only byproducts of perception and invention of beauty.

## About Me
{{< imageRight src="/images/photos/Portrait.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Pascal." caption="Photo credit: Pascal." width="20%" >}}
Hello! I am Anthony, a junior at **Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)**, where I transitioned from an early passion for architecture into the intricate world of geometric structures. **Geometry** is not only the theoretical foundation of civil engineering but also a powerful tool to showcase the uniqueness of **data**. I seek to understand how structures like manifolds and graphs that are inherent in real-world images can be encoded as data.

I find solace in the rich symphonies of Brahms and the leisures that come with travel. My recent course projects and research include symplectic geometry and toric manifolds (undergraduate thesis with Prof. Tang Xiang), Fourier analysis on polytopes (course project in topic course on polytopes), harmonic analysis on groups (research with Prof. Renato Feres), and surface reconstruction for imaging (course project in computational geometry).

## Publications

### 1. Study of Intergenerational Mobility and Urbanization Based on OLS Method and Ordered Probit Model

**IEEE-CS/MSIEID2020, 12/18/2020.**

[DOI: 10.1109/MSIEID52046.2020.00092](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382602)

The study, using the CHARLS dataset and techniques like OLS and ordered probit model, reveals a growing educational disparity across generations in China, highlighting an increasing trend in educational inequality despite overall improvements, especially between urban and rural regions.

## Projects

### 1.  Curvature of Cayley Graph of Certain Groups (working)

**07/2023-Now**

This is a summer research with Prof. Renato Feres beginning in July 2023. The study aims to use efficient algorithms to compute Ollivier-Ricci curvature of Cayley graphs of certain groups and find out some patterns. Currently, efficient optimization algorithm is found for Cayley graph and theoretical justifications for interesting patterns about curvature are concluding.

There is also a second project I am working with Prof. Feres. The project studies the Wasserstein distance of point measures that evolved along their geodesics after initiations.

### 4. Split Spoils: Solution to Stolen Necklace Problem Via Borsuk-Ulam Theorem

**Final project in Prof.Chi's Math 4181 Algebraic Topology, Spring 2022.**

Aiming for high-schooler reading, the paper presents the process of solving a mathematical problem and the use of intuition in solving the 2-dimensional Necklace division problem using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem.

Note: an interesting little book is [Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/akt.html).

### 5. A Note about Algebraic and Geometric Characteristics of Archetypal Riemann Surfaces

**Final project in Dr. Rodsphon's Math 497 Topic in Group Theory, Spring 2023.**

A summary of curvatures, isometry groups, and automorphism groups of 3 Riemann Surfaces $\hat{\mathbb{C}}, \mathbb{C}, \triangle$ in uniformization theorem.
[Paper Link](/pdfs/497_A_Note_on_Algebraic_and_Geometric_Characteristics_of_Archetypal_Riemann_Surfaces.pdf)

A good little book is A.B. Sossinsky's [Geometries](https://bookstore.ams.org/stml-64/), classifying subgroups of $\text{SO}(3)$ and $\text{Isom}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for Platonic bodies and tillings and going through plane, spherical, hyperbolic, and projective geometry.
