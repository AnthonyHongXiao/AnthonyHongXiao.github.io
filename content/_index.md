## About Me

Hello! I am Anthony, a junior at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), where I transitioned from an early passion for architecture into the intricate world of geometric structures. Geometry is not only the theoretical foundation of civil engineering but also a powerful tool to showcase the uniqueness of data. I seek to understand how structures inherent in real-world images can be encoded as data and subsequently take on a geometric and visual form. I also study implications of geometries, manifolds and grpahs, on information and data in general.

I find solace in the rich symphonies of Brahms and the leisures that come with travel. My recent academic interests include algorithmic algebraic geometry/tropical geometry, harmonic analysis on groups, and surface reconstruction for imaging.

## Publications

### 1. Study of Intergenerational Mobility and Urbanization Based on OLS Method and Ordered Probit Model

**IEEE-CS/MSIEID2020, 12/18/2020.**

[DOI: 10.1109/MSIEID52046.2020.00092](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382602)

The study, using the CHARLS dataset and techniques like OLS and ordered probit model, reveals a growing educational disparity across generations in China, highlighting an increasing trend in educational inequality despite overall improvements, especially between urban and rural regions.

## Projects

### 1.  Curvature of Cayley Graph of Certain Groups (working)

**07/2023-Now**

This is a summer research with Prof. Renato Feres beginning in July 2023. The study aims to use efficient algorithms to compute Ollivier-Ricci curvature of Cayley graphs of certain groups and find out some patterns. Currently, efficient optimization algorithm is found for Cayley graph and theoretical justifications for interesting patterns about curvature are concluding.

There is also a second project I am working with Prof. Feres. The project studies the Wasserstein distance of point measures that evolved along their geodesics after initiations.
