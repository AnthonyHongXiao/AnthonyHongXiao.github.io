## About Me
{{< imageRight src="/images/photos/Portrait.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Pascal." caption="Photo credit: Pascal." width="20%" >}}
Hello! I am Anthony, a senior undergraduate at **Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)**, majoring in joint program Econ+CS, with a double major in Mathematics. My early study in architecture and art led me to an interest in **geometry**, which I now explore with a focus on **data** in a broad sense. I‚Äôm interested in various geometric structures, including symplectic and noncommutative geometry, as well as probabilistic and coarse geometry. I also enjoy visual models in low-dimensional topology and discrete differential geometry.

I recently participated in the geometry processing program at [MIT SGI](https://sgi.mit.edu/sgi-2024), where I took part in a tutorial week and group projects guided by both industry professionals and academics. I‚Äôm currently working on my undergraduate thesis in symplectic geometry and toric manifolds with Prof. Tang Xiang.

Outside of math üî¢, I enjoy reading social theories üìñ, listening to classical music üéª, traveling ‚õ∞Ô∏è, and spending time with my cat üêà.

{{< imageRight src="/images/torus.png" alt="Evolving Point Measures." caption="Evolving Point Measures." width="35%" >}}
**Jul 2023 - Jan 2024**

This is a summer research with Prof. Renato Feres beginning in July 2023. The study aims to use efficient algorithms to compute [Ollivier-Ricci curvature](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002212360800493X), or [Lin-Lu-Yau curvature](https://people.math.sc.edu/lu/papers/graphcurv.pdf), of Cayley graphs of certain groups and find out some patterns. Currently, efficient optimization algorithm is found for Cayley graph and theoretical justifications for interesting patterns about curvature are concluding.

There is also a second project I am working with Prof. Feres. The project studies the Wasserstein distance of point measures that evolved along their geodesics after initiations.

$$
W_p(\mu_1,\mu_2)=\left(\inf_{\mu\in \Gamma(\mu_1,\mu_2)}{\int_{X^2}d(x,y)^pd\mu(x,y)}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}=\left(\inf_{\mu\in \Gamma(\mu_1,\mu_2)}{\mathbf{d}(\mu,\nu)^p_{L^p(\mu;X)}}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$
with
$$
\forall A\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{M}):\text{ }\mu_1(t)(A)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\delta_{\gamma_{v_i}(t)}}(A)=\frac{\text{ number of }\gamma_{v_i}(t)\text{ in }A}{n}
$$

### 4. MIT Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI)

**Jul 2024 - Aug 2024**

The [MIT SGI](https://sgi.mit.edu/sgi-2024) is a program that starts with a week-long tutorial in geometry processing, followed by group projects mentored by experts in the field. Below are the projects I contributed to:

#### Deforming Mesh
In this project, I explored different metrics to compare the "wiggliness" of shapes, focusing on Gromov-Hausdorff, Hausdorff, and Chamfer distances. The project involved applying these metrics to analyze and quantify shape dissimilarities. My work contributed to developing a deeper understanding of how these distances can be used in practical geometry processing applications.

[Project Link](https://summergeometry.org/sgi2024/how-to-match-the-wiggliness-of-two-shapes/)

{{< imageRight src="/images/SGI/SDF.png" width="25%" >}}

#### Signed Distance Functions (SDFs)
This project involved designing and reconstructing signed distance functions (SDFs) using the marching squares algorithm. We studied how SDFs can be characterized on planes, proving a theorem that connects SDFs to the Eikonal equation and the closest point condition. The project aimed at improving the precision of surface reconstructions, which has broad implications for fields like computer graphics and computational geometry.

[Part 1](https://summergeometry.org/sgi2024/a-study-on-surface-reconstruction-from-signed-distance-data-part-1/) | [Part 2](https://summergeometry.org/sgi2024/a-study-on-surface-reconstruction-from-signed-distance-data-part-2-error-methods/)

{{< imageRight src="/images/SGI/Nefertiti.png" width="25%" >}}

#### Fitting Inconsistent Input with Noise Regularization
In this project, I worked on reconstructing surfaces from point clouds that include noise and outliers. We utilized shallow neural networks coupled with adversarial modules to regularize the noise and improve the surface fitting process. The project demonstrated how combining machine learning with geometric techniques can lead to more robust and accurate surface reconstructions, even with imperfect data.

[Project Link](https://summergeometry.org/sgi2024/fitting-surfaces-with-noise-regularization/)

#### Winding Numbers Vectorization
This project focused on computing winding numbers, which are essential in understanding the topological properties of shapes. I worked on applying these calculations to a torus and its universal cover, using intrinsic triangulations to optimize the mesh. The project aimed at solving issues related to mesh connectivity and color region disconnections by embedding these properties in a feature space. The work has practical implications for texture mapping and mesh processing in computer graphics.

*Project Link: coming soon.*

#### Bridging Curvatures: From Riemann to Gauss
This project aimed to introduce the concept of curvature to a broader audience, particularly those familiar with surface curvatures. I reviewed the isometric embedding of a flat torus and explored Gromov's convex integration technique. The project served as an educational resource, connecting classical differential geometry concepts with more advanced topics, making them accessible to members of the SGI community.

### 6. Split Spoils: Solution to Stolen Necklace Problem Via Borsuk-Ulam Theorem

**Final project in Prof.Chi's Math 4181 Algebraic Topology, Spring 2022.**

[Report Link](/pdfs/4181_Necklace_Problem.pdf)

Aiming for high-schooler reading, the paper demonstrates how to solve a mathematical problem. Specifically, guided by [Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/akt.html) and 3b1b YouTube [video on necklace problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c), we presented the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem intuitively and used it to solve the 2-dimensional Necklace division problem.

### 7. A Note about Algebraic and Geometric Characteristics of Archetypal Riemann Surfaces

**Final project in Dr. Rodsphon's Math 497 Topic in Group Theory, Spring 2023.**

A.B. Sossinsky in [Geometries](https://bookstore.ams.org/stml-64/) classified subgroups of $\text{SO}(3)$ and $\text{Isom}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for Platonic bodies and tillings. Aimed for understanding such visual applications, we wrote a summary of curvatures, isometry groups, and automorphism groups of 3 Riemann Surfaces $\hat{\mathbb{C}}, \mathbb{C}, \triangle$ in uniformization theorem.
