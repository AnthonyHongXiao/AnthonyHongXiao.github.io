## About Me
I am Anthony, a junior at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). While enjoying mathematical beauty in large, I'm primarily interested in the interaction between geometry and data analysis. Specifically, I like to see how real world images are stored as data and how structure of data is geometrized and visualized. In the following map of "math land," I live in a small cabin in the mountains but often travel to various places.
