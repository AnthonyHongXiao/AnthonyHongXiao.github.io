### About Me

I am Anthony, a junior at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). While enjoying mathematical beauty in large, I'm primarily interested in the interaction between geometry and data analysis. Specifically, I like to see how real world images are stored as data and how the structure of data is geometrized and visualized.

<span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem</span>Curvature of Cayley Graph of Certain Groups (working)

This is a summer research with Professor Renato Feres beginning in July 2023. The study aims to use efficient algorithms to compute Ollivier-Ricci curvature of Cayley graphs of certain groups and find out some patterns.

[DOI: 10.1109/MSIEID52046.2020.00092](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382602)

The study, using the CHARLS dataset and techniques like OLS and ordered probit model, reveals a growing educational disparity across generations in China, highlighting an increasing trend in educational inequality despite overall improvements, especially between urban and rural regions.
