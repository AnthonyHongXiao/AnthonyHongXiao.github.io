## About Me
I am Anthony, a junior at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). While enjoying mathematical beauty in large, I'm primarily interested in the interaction between geometry and data analysis. Specifically, I like to see how real world images are stored as data and how structure of data is geometrized and visualized.

In the following map of "math land," I wish to live in a small cabin in the mountains but often travel to various places.

<strong><span style="font-size: smaller;">Study of Intergenerational Mobility and Urbanization Based on OLS Method and Ordered Probit Model</span></strong>, IEEE-CS/MSIEID2020

[DOI: 10.1109/MSIEID52046.2020.00092](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382602)

The study, using the CHARLS dataset and techniques like OLS and ordered probit model, reveals a growing educational disparity across generations in China, highlighting an increasing trend in educational inequality despite overall improvements, especially between urban and rural regions.
