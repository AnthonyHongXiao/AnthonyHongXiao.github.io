I began a project with Dr. Bu on topic of quantum information geometry in summer of 2023. The following note is a short summary of [*Information Theory From Coding to Learning*](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~yw562/teaching/itbook-export.pdf) by Yury Polyanskiy and Yihong Wu plus self-contained preliminaries on probability theory.
