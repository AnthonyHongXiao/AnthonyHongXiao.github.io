This reading file is for preparing the undergraduate thesis on Symplectic geometry and momental maps, supervised by Prof. Tang Xiang.

Our first reading is Ana Cannas da Silva's *Lectures on Symplectic Geometry* (version: Jan 2006). Our plan is to read Lecture 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,18,21,22,23,24,,27,28,29,30.

Here is the [Note](/pdfs/Symplectic.pdf).
