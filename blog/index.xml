Developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother Katharine Briggs in the mid-20th century, the MBTI is based on the psychological theories of Carl Jung.
The assessment categorizes personalities into 16 distinct types based on four dichotomies:
Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I): Describes where individuals prefer to focus their attention and get their energy—from external objects, people, and activities (E) or their inner world of ideas and experiences (I).</description></item><item><title>Fork and Bar</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/fork-and-bar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 02:26:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/fork-and-bar/</guid><description>Part One: Reflections on Frost and O. Henry Learning singular homology in a bar. Photo credit: Jessie. There&amp;rsquo;s a peculiar sort of kinship between the gentle unease of O. Henry&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Roads of Destiny&amp;rdquo; and the reflective ponderings within Frost&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Road Not Taken.&amp;rdquo; Both weave a complex fabric of destiny and choice. O. Henry&amp;rsquo;s characters, with their twisted fates, remind me of the capricious nature of life&amp;rsquo;s journey. Frost&amp;rsquo;s poem, a gift from my friend Sam Chen, captures the essence of that journey—each decision point a divergence into a new possibility, a contemplative look at the paths we choose and those we leave behind.</description></item><item><title>Some Markdown Grammer Issues</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/some-markdown-grammer-issues/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 16:07:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/some-markdown-grammer-issues/</guid><description>❌: \left{ \right} ✅: \set{ }

Sossinsky&amp;rsquo;s Geometries 7.8 Hyperbolic Geometry and the Physical World
In his famous book Science et Hypothèse, Henri Poincaré describes the physics of a small &amp;ldquo;universe&amp;rdquo; and the physical theories that its inhabitants would create. The universe considered by Poincaré is Euclidean, plane (two-dimensional), and has the form of an open unit disk. Its temperature is $100^{\circ}$ Farenheit at the center of the disk and decreases linearly to absolute zero at its boundary.</description></item><item><title>Manifold Garden and Hilbert's Hotel</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/manifold-garden-and-hilberts-hotel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 10:00:14 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/manifold-garden-and-hilberts-hotel/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Manifold Garden&amp;rdquo; is really a marvel of puzzle game design, inviting players into an ethereal world where gravity is a toy and infinity a canvas. I played it during my freshman year and want to introduce you to this feast for the eyes.
Developed by William Chyr, this game stands as a monument to the beauty of architectural impossibilities (Hilbert&amp;rsquo;s Hotel; see the end of this blog) and geometry (mostly Euclidena but also has a rubber-sheet flavour).</description></item><item><title>Covering Spaces of Wedge of Two Circles</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/covering-spaces-of-wedge-of-two-circles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 08:38:28 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/covering-spaces-of-wedge-of-two-circles/</guid><description>We start with some theorems from Hatcher&amp;rsquo;s algebraic topology and will give a solution of the following exercise by enumeration.
Find all the connected 2-sheeted and 3-sheeted covering spaces of $S^1 \vee S^1$​, up to isomorphism of covering spaces without basepoints. Review of Hatcher Proposition 1.32. The number of sheets of a covering space $p:(\widetilde{X}, \widetilde{x_0}) \to (X, x_0)$ with $X$ and $\widetilde{X}$ path-connected equals the index of $p_*\left(\pi_1\left(\widetilde{X}, \widetilde{x_0}\right)\right)$ in $\pi_1\left(X, x_0\right)$.</description></item><item><title>Brahms and Strauss</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/brahms-and-strauss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 22:24:27 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/brahms-and-strauss/</guid><description>Post-romantic music, epitomized by the likes of Johannes Brahms and Richard Strauss, dives deep into a realm where intense emotions are paramount. Brahms&amp;rsquo; compositions resonate with a profound sense of grief, yet there&amp;rsquo;s a fiery undercurrent of rage that seems to threaten the very fabric of the world, as if it could tear it apart and reduce it to ashes. This emotional power, coupled with the structural legacies of Beethoven and Bach, makes his music enduringly impactful.</description></item><item><title>Schubert and Hilbert</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/schubert-and-hilbert/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 10:09:15 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/schubert-and-hilbert/</guid><description>The Austrian composer Franz Schubert&amp;rsquo;s response to Beethoven&amp;rsquo;s string quartets, &amp;ldquo;Now that such works have been composed, I have no regrets,&amp;rdquo; poignantly captures a moment of profound artistic realization and humility. This statement, made shortly before his untimely death at the age of thirty-one, reflects a deep sense of fulfillment and resignation. Schubert, in his brief life, grappled with the enormity of his own artistic contribution in the shadow of a colossus like Beethoven.</description></item><item><title>About Applied Math</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/about-applied-math/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 10:09:15 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/about-applied-math/</guid><description>There can be a common misconception about the phrase &amp;ldquo;applied math&amp;rdquo;. Contrary to the prevalent belief that applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to other fields, it is actually the reverse. In reality, applied mathematics involves using concepts and methods from other disciplines within the framework of mathematics. This is better understood when considering the difference between the terms &amp;lsquo;applied math&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;mathematical application&amp;rsquo;. The former implies a broader scope where external concepts are integrated into mathematical contexts, while the latter suggests a more limited view where mathematics is merely applied as a tool in various fields.</description></item><item><title>Cayley Graphs on Surfaces</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/cayley-graphs-on-surfaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:09:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/cayley-graphs-on-surfaces/</guid><description>Some aspects may be related:
