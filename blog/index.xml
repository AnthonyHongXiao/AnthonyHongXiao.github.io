Contrary to the prevalent belief that applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to other fields, it is actually the reverse. In reality, applied mathematics involves using concepts and methods from other disciplines within the framework of mathematics. This is better understood when considering the difference between the terms &amp;lsquo;applied math&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;mathematical application&amp;rsquo;. The former implies a broader scope where external concepts are integrated into mathematical contexts, while the latter suggests a more limited view where mathematics is merely applied as a tool in various fields.</description></item><item><title>Cayley Graphs on Surfaces</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/cayley-graphs-on-surfaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:09:15 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/cayley-graphs-on-surfaces/</guid><description>Some aspects may be related:
curvature of cayley graph
curavture of surface (The convergence result that for n going to infinity, the Ollivier-Ricci curvature of the random geometric graph sampled from manifold converges to the Ricci curvature of the manifold) (and for more general theory, see Graphs of Groups on Surface: Interactions and Models by Arthur T. White).

Terrace Tao&amp;rsquo;s blog: he builds some analogies of geometric structure between group and manifold, including abelianness&amp;ndash;flatness (zero curvature), subgroups&amp;ndash;foliations, normal subgroups&amp;ndash;bundles&amp;hellip;
John Meier&amp;rsquo;s little blue LMS book: Groups, Graphs, and Trees: An Introduction to the Geometry of Infinite Groups. The book &amp;ldquo;proceeds step by carefully placed step, quite rapidly and naturally through many of the key ideas of modern geometric group theory,&amp;rdquo; reviewed by Jon McCammond, UCSB.</description></item><item><title>Website logistics</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/website-logistics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 19:29:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/website-logistics/</guid><description>After committing and pushing get stucked: for uncommited changes: git commit -m &amp;ldquo;Your commit message&amp;rdquo;
discard unstaged changes (note that directly copying from website will give a single - instead of consecutive two -): git checkout &amp;ndash; .
for &amp;ldquo;already exists&amp;rdquo; branch: git branch -d branch_name
use link to restore: rebrase and other commands.
To create a new blog: terminal (top of the mac computer) &amp;ndash; new terminal &amp;ndash; type hugo new blog/name.</description></item><item><title>Markdown Syntax Guide</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/markdown-syntax-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/markdown-syntax-guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a quick cheatsheet, check out &lt;a href="https://simplemde.com/markdown-guide">https://simplemde.com/markdown-guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
