In first note on HDP, we introduced the bounded difference inequality, which is a result that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The bounded difference property may be thought of as a type of smoothness condition. Recall that a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is $L$-Lipschitz if the following holds for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq L|x-y|$.</description></item><item><title>High-Dimensional Probability and Statistics II</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 17:53:24 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob2/</guid><description>This file is for the notes and exercises for the book Roman Vershynin&amp;rsquo;s High-Dimensional Probability, one of the references used in Prof Lunde&amp;rsquo;s Math5440.

The second file will contain chapter 5,7,8. Some topics will be singled out to become files of their own.
