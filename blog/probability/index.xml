In first note on HDP, we introduced the bounded difference inequality, which is a result that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The bounded difference property may be thought of as a type of smoothness condition. Recall that a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is $L$-Lipschitz if the following holds for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq L\Vert x-y\Vert $.</description></item><item><title>High-Dimensional Probability and Statistics</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob_and_satistics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 12:01:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/high_dim_prob_and_satistics/</guid><description>This file is the first of the two for the notes and exercises in the book Roman Vershynin&amp;rsquo;s High-Dimensional Probability, one of the references used in Prof Lunde&amp;rsquo;s Math5440. The other references are Ramon van Handel&amp;rsquo;s Probability in High Dimension and Martin J.Wainwright&amp;rsquo;s High-Dimensional Statistics. The file contains chapter 0,1,2,3,4, which cover some of the basic notions. We will use two other reading files for further topics, one for concentration of Lipschitz functions (chapter 5) and one for Random and Empirical Processes (chapter 7 and 8).</description></item></channel></rss>
