Like rhetoric, geometry structures our understanding and shapes how we interpret the world.
But what exactly is geometry? It’s nearly impossible to define without it dissolving into algebra, topology, or analysis. When we talk about metrics, we often mean analysis, while the “geometry” of graphs is actually combinatorics, using terms like diameter or bridges for rhetorical flair.</description></item><item><title>Symplectic Geometry</title><link>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/symplectic_geometry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 09:38:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyHongXiao.github.io/reading/symplectic_geometry/</guid><description>This reading file is for preparing the undergraduate thesis on Symplectic geometry and momental maps, supervised by Prof. Tang Xiang.
